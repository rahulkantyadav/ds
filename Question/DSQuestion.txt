8. Binary tree to DLL.
9. Give all pair present in array. Duplicate can be present in it.
10. find node at kth distance from node in B tree.
11. find diameter of b tree.

14. There is a audio player given which picks up a random song from the playlist and plays it.The song should not be repeated until all songs are played atleast once.The sequence number of the songs are given in an array.Design such audio player without using any extra space. I suggested him to use a pointer say ‘pivot’ that initially points to the last element of array. The songs to the left of the array are not yet played and the songs to the right are already played and cannot be repeated.
